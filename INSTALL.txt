 INSTALL:

 This library contains the code as in the paper 
    Andreas Abel, Stephan Adelsberger, Anton Setzer: Interactive Programming in 
        Agda - Objects and Graphical User Interfaces
        Journal of Functional Programming, 27, 2017. Doi 10.1017/S0956796816000319 
        author's copy: http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/articles/ooAgda.pdf
        bibtex:        http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/articles/ooAgda.bib

 The following are the preliminary installation instructions, we are currently
 working on a more detailed documentation of the library.


 The code works with the most recent version of Agda version 2.5
 (master branch from github, commit
 "useefd12c778e095ee783eeb1f845fc1938ea360204").


 The current agda code uses the haskell graphic library "wxhaskell" and
 implements a small game, where a space ship can be moved with the arrow keys.


 Please note: file path are set for linux/unix, for Windows adapt the file
 "./examples/StateSized/GUI/ShipBitMap.agda".


 Details:

  - Install agda from git:

    git clone https://github.com/agda/agda.git

    sudo cabal update
  
    in the created directory
 
    sudo cabal install --global
    agda-mode setup

  - Install Agda standard library version (latest master branch version,
    tested with commit "545b94b81e4eb1d5a8b2b9f1083b12de5422d786") 
    from https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib

    git clone https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib

    (adaption of library files see below)

  - If you want to write GUI programs such as the space ship example
    you need to install wxWidgets and wxHaskell as follows, 
    otherwise (if you only want to work with objects in Agda or with console IO)
    you can continue directly with "Set up the agda library files"  below
   

      - Install wxWidgets version 3.0.2
	https://www.wxwidgets.org/
	Follow the installation instructions in for the latest stable version
	("Latest Stable Release: 3.0.2" not the development version)

	Follow the instructions in 

	https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/v3.0.2/docs/readme.txt

	and use the installation instructions for gtk,
	with instructions in the downloaded version
	at  wxWidgets-3.1.0/docs/gtk/install.txt
	(easiest to follow instructions "The simplest case")

      - Install wxHaskell from github
	https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell
	(latest master branch version, tested with commit
	"db2a571300b5810a7dadfe117744e5b9389e0c9b"")

	Best is to clone  
	https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell
	by using
	git clone https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell

	Then follow instructions at 
	install.txt

	possibly replace  there 
	cabal install 
	by
	sudo cabal install 
	or
	sudo cabal install  --global
	or
	cabal install --global




  - Set up the agda library files:
 
    In "~/.agda/libraries" add the following three lines:
     -----------
    /home/username/Downloads/agda-master/agda-stdlib/standard-library.agda-lib
    /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/src/ooAgda.agda-lib
    /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/examples/ooAgdaExamples.agda-lib
    ----------

    with the paths adapted to where your version of std-lib (Agda standard lib)
     and of ooAgda  is located

  - For using the libraries in your code add a library file (e.g. a copy of 
    ~/git/ooagda/examples/ooAgdaExamples.agda-lib
     ) to the directory containing your code


    For more information on the library files,
    please refer to the changelog of Agda "2.5.1":
    https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/master/CHANGELOG
