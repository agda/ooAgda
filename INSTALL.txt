 INSTALL:

 The following are the preliminary installation instructions, we are currently
 working on a more detailed documentation of the library.


 The code works with the most recent version of Agda version 2.5
 (master branch from github, commit
 "useefd12c778e095ee783eeb1f845fc1938ea360204").


 The current agda code uses the haskell graphic library "wxhaskell" and
 implements a small game, where a space ship can be moved with the arrow keys.


 Please note: file path are set for linux/unix, for Windows adapt the file
 "./examples/StateSized/GUI/ShipBitMap.agda".


 Details:

  - Install agda from git:

    git clone https://github.com/agda/agda.git

    sudo cabal update
  
    in the created directory
 
    sudo cabal install --global
    agda-mode setup

  - Install Agda standard library version (latest master branch version,
    tested with commit "545b94b81e4eb1d5a8b2b9f1083b12de5422d786") 
    from https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib

    git clone https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib

    (adaption of library files see below)

  - Install wxWidgets version 3.0.2
    https://www.wxwidgets.org/
    Follow the installation instructions in for the latest stable version
    ("Latest Stable Release: 3.0.2" not the development version)

    Follow the instructions in 

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/v3.0.2/docs/readme.txt

    and use the installation instructions for gtk,
    with instructions in the downloaded version
    at  wxWidgets-3.1.0/docs/gtk/install.txt
    (easiest to follow instructions "The simplest case")

  - Install wxHaskell from github
    https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell
    (latest master branch version, tested with commit
    "db2a571300b5810a7dadfe117744e5b9389e0c9b"")

    Best is to clone  
    https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell
    by using
    git clone https://github.com/wxHaskell/wxHaskell

    Then follow instructions at 
    install.txt

    possibly replace  there 
    cabal install 
    by
    sudo cabal install 
    or
    sudo cabal install  --global
    or
    cabal install --global




  - Set up the agda library files:
 
    In "~/.agda/libraries" add the following three lines:
     -----------
    /home/username/Downloads/agda-master/agda-stdlib/src/std.agda-lib
    /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/src/ionew.agda-lib
    /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/examples/ioexamples.agda-lib
    ----------

    with the paths adapted to where your version of std-lib (Agda standard lib)
     and of ooAgda  is located

    Create the file
    "/home/username/Downloads/agda-master/agda-stdlib/src/std.agda-lib" 
    (adapt the path so that it points to your version of the agda standard 
    library) with the following content (two lines):

 ----------
 name: std-lib
 include: .
 ----------

    For more information on the library files,
    please refer to the changelog of Agda "2.5.1":
