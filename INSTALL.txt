 INSTALL:

 The following are the preliminary installation instructions, we are currently
 working on a more detailed documentation of the library.


 The code works with the most resent version of Agda version 2.5
 (master branch from github, commit
 "useefd12c778e095ee783eeb1f845fc1938ea360204").


 The current agda code uses the haskell graphic library "wxhaskell" and
 implements a small game, where a space ship can be moved with the arrow keys.


 Please note: file path are set for linux/unix, for Windows adapt the file
 "./examples/StateSized/GUI/ShipBitMap.agda".

  - Install Agda standard library version (latest master branch version,
    tested with commit "545b94b81e4eb1d5a8b2b9f1083b12de5422d786")

 IMPORTANT:

 It is needed to set up the agda library files, so
 in "~/.agda" set up the following files:

 In "~/.agda/libraries" add the following three lines:
 -----------
 /home/username/Downloads/agda-master/agda-stdlib/src/std.agda-lib
 /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/src/ionew.agda-lib
 /home/username/Downloads/ooAgda/examples/ioexamples.agda-lib
 ----------

 with the paths adapted to your std-lib (Agda standard lib)
 and your ooAgda folder.

 Create the file
 "/home/username/Downloads/agda-master/agda-stdlib/src/std.agda-lib" (path
 adapted)  with the following content (three lines):
 ----------
 name: std-lib
 include: .
 ----------

 For more information on the library files,
 please refer to the changelog of Agda "2.5.1":
